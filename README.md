# HIGHSCHOOL-Matura-Clash-of-Titans
This is my Highschool matura project. It is a XNA game written in C# programming language. Game is called Clash of Titans and the best description of this game would be Robot boxing. 

## Description
There are 2 robots in a boxing ring. One is blue (player) and one is red (computer). The player has the ability to move and punch. It has also ability to change from third-person to first-person camera. First-person camera has a nice GUI added for better experience. This project was made in last year of highschool and graphics might not be the best, because I was a newbie in game development.

## Graphics
Graphics in this game were made entirely by me. I used Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop. 

## Requirements
Computer on which you want to run a game must have XNA framework redistributable installed. Without it, game will not work. Also during testing this game, I noticed that some computers couldn't run game. Why is that - I don't know :D
